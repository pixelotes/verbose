# Verbose - Stage 3

**Verbose** is a lightweight, self-hosted chat UI that mimics the style of ChatGPT. It is built using **Flutter Web** for the frontend and **FastAPI** (Python) for the backend. In Stage 3, the aim is to keep improving the UI and preparing both the backend and frontend for streaming responses support.

Planned for this stage:
- Further UI enhancements:
