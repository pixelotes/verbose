# Verbose - Stage 2

**Verbose** is a lightweight, self-hosted chat UI that mimics the style of ChatGPT. It is built using **Flutter Web** for the frontend and **FastAPI** (Python) for the backend. In Stage 2, the aim is to add support for OpenAI-compatible APIs. Also, instead of being hardcoded, it will read the endpoint and API keys from environment (and in later stages it will be configurable from the options screen).

## TBD:
- Add an overview of the new project structure and components
- Explain the changes made to the components and the current status
- Update the dependencies
- Update the instructions to run the project
- Update the instructions for testing the components
- Once everything else is done, update the dev plan and merge this branch into main.
